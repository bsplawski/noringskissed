<h4 id="by-brock-splawski">by: Brock Splawski</h4>
<p>Writing, for me, can come in fits and spurts. It’s a bad habit, generally, to be undisciplined in my chosen craft like this, but that’s how it goes.</p>
<p>In my less productive moments, I try to at least read, just so I don’t feel like I’m losing the spirit altogether. (In my <em>least</em> productive moments, it’s probably web browsing, which is still plenty of reading but not exactly the kind I would like to do.) This week, I finished Viet Thanh Nguyen’s <em>To Save and to Destroy</em>, a series of Norton lectures done at Harvard University in 2023. The subtitle for this collection is <em>Writing as an Other</em>, the <em>other</em> meaning a whole host of similar definitions, but for Viet, applying specifically to his background as an immigrant to the United States from South Vietnam.</p>
<p>My perspective, as an American whose family has lived here for generations, is not as an <em>other</em>. Far from it, really. In that sense, I greatly appreciated reading his perspective. In one essay, he mentions that the best kind of writing is done with a voice that assumes its audience could understand what was being said completely.</p>
<p>He says, “I am not a minority if I think of myself as being part of a world, a globe…if, when I am writing, I write first of all to myself, because I contain multitudes. And I am not a minority if I write to Vietnamese people. Everyone else can listen in.”</p>
<p>I read this during a time of relative conflict between how I could fit writing and music in with my increasingly busy day-to-day life. As such, I found reading this work to be encouraging, really, to encourage me to continue shaping and honing my own voice and my own perspective within my work. That is probably a little self-centered, but it’s the truth, I suppose. But I think beyond that, this was a detailed and insightful read about writing, about reading, about the cross-cultural relationships formed in relation to perception, and the deep effect it can have on peoples’ lives. I’d recommend reading it if you can find it.</p>
