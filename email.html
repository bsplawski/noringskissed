        <h2>NO RINGS KISSED: how to sign up</h2>
        <br>
        <p>No Rings Kissed does not utilize a standard email marketing platform to run its newsletter. However, it's also a huge pain to provide a one-click option on one's own that won't be plagued by bots, and also not run afoul of new privacy laws.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To combat this, this newsletter is old-school: to sign up for the newsletter, please either use this <a href="mailto:noringskissed@proton.me?subject=New Signup&body=Email address: %0D%0AName a song that reminds you of childhood, and why (this is to prove you're not a bot):">mailto option here</a>, or reach out to <strong>noringskissed@proton.me</strong> with the following template:</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Subject:</strong> New Signup</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Body:</strong> List your email address and name one song that reminds you of your childhood, and why.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Failure to follow the above template will result in your email address not be signed up for the newsletter, so make sure to follow it! Thanks. <3</p>
